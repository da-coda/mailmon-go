## Why MailPie?
MailPie aims to satisfy your needs in development and testing environments regarding mails.
With multiple ways to view your mails you are able to test and debug in dev and test environments
without any actual SMTP servers.

### Features
#### Implemented
Currently, MailPie only supports simple SMTP and IMAP. You are able to add MailPie as an SMTP server f√ºr your project
and as an IMAP server for you mail client. Any mail sent via SMTP to MailPie will be visible in your mail client.

#### Planned
- Dockerize MailPie and put it on Dockerhub for simple usage
- Webinterface with Vue 3 and Vuetify communicating over Server-Send-Events with the backend
- REST-API that can be used in test suites for mail testing
- Switch from hardcoded stuff like ports to a way to use configs and CLI flags; Add debug mode
- Codeception(PHP) Module for testing with the REST-API
- Advanced SMTP and IMAP handling
- Maybe supporting usage as a proxy mail server for mail logging?
- Implement [spamassassin](https://github.com/Teamwork/spamc) support

## How to use MailPie?
### SMTP - settings in your project
1. Execute the MailPie binary or build the binary yourself
2. Add MailPie as you SMTP Server to your project
    - *Port*: 1025

duration.
