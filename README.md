## Why MailPie?
MailPie aims to satisfy your needs in development and testing environments regarding mails.
With multiple ways to view your mails you are able to test and debug in dev and test environments
without any actual SMTP servers.

### Features
#### Implemented
Currently, MailPie only supports simple SMTP and IMAP. You are able to add MailPie as an SMTP server for your project
and as an IMAP server for you mail client. Any mail sent via SMTP to MailPie will be visible in your mail client.
You can configure MailPie by providing a config file or with CLI arguments.

#### Planned
- Webinterface with Vue 3 communicating over Server-Send-Events and REST Api with the backend
- REST-API that can be used in test suites for mail testing
- Codeception(PHP) Module for testing with the REST-API
- Advanced SMTP and IMAP handling
- Maybe supporting usage as a proxy mail server for mail logging?
- Implement [spamassassin](https://github.com/Teamwork/spamc) support
